# Bed Management module

## Overview

The Bed Management module brings in the data model, DAO entities, services and REST API layers for managing beds, admission locations and all other backend entities that relates to IPD Ward Management.
This module was originally built and bundled within the [Bahmni distribution](https://github.com/Bahmni/openmrs-distro-bahmni) of OpenMRS, though is not limited to use by Bahmni.

> Note that its _admin_ UI is shipped as an OWA, see [here](owa/README.md) for more details about it.
> The module can be run without the OpenMRS owa module, which will provide access to API and web services.  The owa module is required as a companion module to run the bundled admin UI.
